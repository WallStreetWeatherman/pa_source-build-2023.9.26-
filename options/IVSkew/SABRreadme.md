1. The SABR Model:
The SABR model is designed to capture the volatility smile, which is the observed pattern in which implied volatilities vary for options across different strike prices. The SABR model's full name, "Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho," describes its key parameters:

Alpha (α): Represents the "level" or overall magnitude of volatility.

Beta (β): Dictates how the forward price evolves. A β of 1 means the forward evolves log-normally, whereas a β of 0 indicates a normal process. Most of the time, β is somewhere in between, which captures the skewness in the volatility.

Rho (ρ): The correlation between the forward rate and its volatility. This is crucial because a change in the forward rate can affect the option's volatility.

Nu (ν): The "volatility of volatility." It dictates how much the volatility itself can fluctuate.

Using these parameters, the SABR model can express a functional form for implied volatility as a function of the strike price, which can capture the skew and smile often observed in markets. This makes it especially versatile for pricing exotic options and other derivatives.

2. Numerical Solver with SABR:
Calibrating the SABR model means finding the values of α, β, ρ, and ν such that the model's implied volatilities fit market-observed implied volatilities as closely as possible. Given the complexity of the SABR formula, an analytical solution for this calibration process is usually not feasible. Hence, numerical methods are needed.

Here's how the numerical solver interacts with the SABR model:

Objective Function:

This function calculates the difference (or error) between the implied volatilities predicted by the SABR model (for a given set of parameters) and market-observed implied volatilities. The goal is to minimize this error.
Optimization:

Numerical solvers use optimization algorithms to search the parameter space (α, β, ρ, ν) to find values that minimize the objective function. In your script, the minimize function from scipy.optimize is used for this purpose.
Constraints and Bounds:

Some parameters have specific bounds. For example, β should be between 0 and 1, and ρ should be between -1 and 1. The solver must adhere to these bounds when searching for the optimal parameters.
Initial Guess:

Solvers require a starting point or an initial guess for the parameters. From this point, they'll explore the parameter space to find a solution. A good initial guess can speed up the convergence, while a bad one can lead the solver to a sub-optimal solution or even make it fail to converge.
