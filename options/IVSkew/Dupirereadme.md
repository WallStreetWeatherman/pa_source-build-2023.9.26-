1. Purpose of the Script:
The script calculates local volatility (deterministic volatility as a function of stock price and time) using Dupire's formula.
2. Components of the Script:
Sample market implied volatilities: The script starts with an illustrative grid of implied volatilities (IMPLIED_VOLS) for a range of strikes (STRIKES) and maturities (MATURITIES).

Cubic spline interpolation: Given that option prices might not be available for every strike and maturity combination, the script uses cubic spline interpolation to create a smooth implied volatility surface (ivol_surface) from the given data.

Dupire's formula with finite differences: The heart of the script is the local_volatility function. It uses Dupire's formula to derive the local volatility, and finite differences to calculate the necessary partial derivatives of implied volatility with respect to price and time.

3. How to Use the Script with Stock Options:
Collect Market Data: Gather market-implied volatilities for European call or put options across various strikes and maturities for the stock in question. The more data you have, the better and smoother the resulting local volatility surface will be.

Input the Data: Replace the sample STRIKES, MATURITIES, and IMPLIED_VOLS data in the script with your collected data.

Run the Script: Execute the script to calculate the local volatility at a particular stock price and time to maturity.

Use the Local Volatility: Once you've calculated the local volatility surface, you can use it to price other derivatives like exotic options or structured products. Typically, you'd input the local volatility surface into a separate pricing model tailored for the specific derivative you're interested in.

4. Important Considerations:
Accuracy: The accuracy of the local volatility model largely depends on the quality and density of the input implied volatility data. Ensure that the implied volatilities you use are reliable.

Interpolation and Extrapolation: The script uses cubic spline interpolation to estimate implied volatilities between data points. Be cautious about extrapolating outside the range of your data, as the behavior can become unpredictable.

Arbitrage Considerations: In some cases, the resulting local volatility surface might need further refinement to ensure it's arbitrage-free.

Real-World Application: While the script provides a basic implementation of Dupire's model, real-world applications often involve more sophisticated techniques and refinements.

In summary, gather European option prices (or implied volatilities) for a stock, input that data into the script, then use the derived local volatility surface to price or analyze other derivatives or trading strategies.
