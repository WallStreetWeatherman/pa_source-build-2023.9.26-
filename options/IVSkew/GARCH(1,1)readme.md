The model is termed "GARCH(1,1)" because it considers one lag of both past squared returns (the ARCH term) and past conditional variances (the GARCH term). The sum of α 1β1 gives an indication of the persistence of a shock to volatility. If their sum is close to one, shocks to volatility are highly persistent.

In essence, the GARCH(1,1) model helps in:

Describing how volatility changes over time.
Forecasting future volatility based on past returns and past volatilities.
Capturing the volatility clustering effect observed in financial time series, where high volatility days tend to be followed by high volatility days and low volatility days tend to be followed by low volatility days.
