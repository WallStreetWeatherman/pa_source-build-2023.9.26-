Ohlson O-Score
Developed by James Ohlson, the Ohlson O-Score is designed to predict the probability that a company will go bankrupt. It uses a logistic function to incorporate several accounting variables and is considered one of the robust models for bankruptcy prediction.

Beneish M-Score (Different from Benish)
The Beneish M-Score is another statistical model used to detect earnings manipulation. Developed by Messod Beneish, it is similar in intent to the Benish M-Score but uses a different set of variables.

DuPont Analysis
The DuPont analysis breaks down the return on equity (ROE) into several different components to analyze the root cause of the company's profitability. Though it's not a "score" per se, DuPont analysis provides a detailed look at the drivers of a company's profitability.

Taffler Z-Score
Another metric designed for bankruptcy prediction, the Taffler Z-Score uses four financial ratios and is specifically designed for UK-based companies. It is similar in many ways to the Altman Z-Score but tailored for a different market.

Springate Model
This is another bankruptcy prediction model that uses four financial ratios. Unlike the Altman Z-Score, the Springate Model is considered simpler and is often used for smaller companies.

Zmijewski Score
This bankruptcy prediction model uses three financial ratios and is based on a logistic model, similar to the Ohlson O-Score. It aims to predict bankruptcy within a year and is often used in parallel with other scores for more comprehensive analysis.

Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Debt-to-Equity Ratio
While not composite "scores," these financial ratios are often used in fundamental analysis to gauge liquidity and solvency. They are considered baseline metrics that provide insight into a company's financial health.

Graham Number and Graham Formula
Named after the father of value investing, Benjamin Graham, these metrics are used to find the intrinsic value of a stock. Though they don't provide a "score," they are part of a fundamental analysis toolkit.

Free Cash Flow Models (e.g., DCF Analysis)
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis isn't a score but is a common method for estimating the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. This form of valuation plays a crucial role in investment analysis.

These are just a few examples, and each has its strengths, limitations, and best-use scenarios. Due diligence often involves using multiple metrics and models to get a comprehensive understanding of a company's financial health.
