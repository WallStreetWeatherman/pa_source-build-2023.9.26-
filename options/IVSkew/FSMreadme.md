Fengler's Semiparametric Model calculates the implied volatility surface for option prices. In financial markets, the implied volatility surface is a three-dimensional plot that shows the volatility of an option for various strike prices and expiration dates. The surface provides valuable insights into how market participants perceive future volatility and price risks at different levels.

The key features of Fengler's Semiparametric Model are:

Flexibility: By combining parametric and non-parametric elements, the model offers flexibility in capturing the features of the implied volatility surface. This includes the well-known "smile" or "smirk" shapes that can arise, particularly for options that are far out-of-the-money or close to expiration.

Data-Driven Approach: The non-parametric component of the model allows for a data-driven approach to capture the entire implied volatility surface without imposing a strict functional form, as many other models do. This means the model can adjust better to actual market data.

Reduction of Dimensionality: Fengler's model, through its semiparametric nature, can capture complex structures in the volatility surface while partially avoiding the curse of dimensionality that purely non-parametric models might suffer from.

In essence, Fengler's Semiparametric Model provides a method to interpolate and extrapolate the implied volatility for any given combination of strike price and time to maturity, based on the observed market prices of options. This can be invaluable for traders and risk managers who need to price or value options that are not actively traded in the market.
