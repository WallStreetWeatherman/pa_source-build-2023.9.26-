Merton's Jump Diffusion model is an extension of the standard geometric Brownian motion model (used in the Black-Scholes option pricing formula) that incorporates sudden price jumps. The standard geometric Brownian motion assumes that stock prices evolve in a continuous manner, which might not capture real-world events like corporate announcements, geopolitical events, sudden market shocks, etc., that cause abrupt stock price movements.

In essence, Merton's Jump Diffusion model calculates or simulates the evolution of a stock price over time by considering:

Standard Brownian motion: This is the usual continuous price movement driven by volatility (sigma) and the risk-free rate (r).

Jump component: This accounts for sudden, discontinuous jumps in the stock price. The model assumes that these jumps happen following a Poisson process with intensity (lam). When a jump occurs, the magnitude of the jump is typically modeled using a normal distribution with mean (mu_j) and standard deviation (sigma_j).

Thus, the model captures both the continuous price movements and sudden jumps, making it a more realistic representation of stock price dynamics.

To summarize, Merton's Jump Diffusion model calculates/simulates the stock price path over time while taking into account the possibility of sudden jumps in addition to the continuous price evolution. This is particularly useful for option pricing and risk management, as the presence of jumps can significantly affect the value of financial derivatives.


The Implied Volatility (IV) Skew (or "volatility skew") refers to the pattern where options on the same underlying asset and expiration, but with different strike prices, have different implied volatilities. A common observation in the market is that out-of-the-money (OTM) put options often have higher implied volatilities than at-the-money (ATM) or in-the-money (ITM) options. This is typically because market participants are willing to pay a premium for downside protection, reflecting the asymmetric nature of market returns (fear of market crashes or large downward jumps).

Merton's Jump Diffusion model, by introducing jumps into stock price dynamics, offers an explanation for the observed IV Skew:

Jumps and IV Skew: Large negative jumps (which are often more of a concern to investors than large positive jumps) can result in OTM puts being more sensitive to jumps than ATM or ITM options. As a result, OTM puts would carry a higher implied volatility to reflect this jump risk.

Model Calibration: In practical applications, you can calibrate the parameters of the Jump Diffusion model (like the intensity and average size of the jumps) to fit the observed market option prices across various strikes. By doing so, the model can replicate the observed IV Skew in the market.

Pricing and Hedging: Once the model is calibrated to fit the market skew, it can be used to price and hedge exotic options or other derivatives that might be sensitive to jumps in the underlying.

Risk Management: For risk managers, understanding the skew and the potential for price jumps is crucial. It gives insight into potential "tail risks" or extreme events that might not be captured by standard volatility models.

In essence, the Jump Diffusion model offers a theoretical foundation to explain the empirically observed IV Skew. When the model is fit to market data, the parameters related to jumps give insights into market perceptions about the likelihood and severity of extreme price moves. This relationship between jumps and skew makes the model particularly valuable for practitioners who want to understand, price, or hedge options in the presence of skew.
