How it works:
SABR Volatility Model:

Your script begins with the sabr_volatility function which, given a set of parameters, will compute the implied volatility for an option with a specific forward rate F, strike price K, and time to expiration T.
The SABR model is known for its flexibility, and its parameters allow it to model different shapes of the volatility smile/skew.
Calibration Error Calculation:

The calibration_error function computes the discrepancy between market-observed implied volatilities and the volatilities predicted by the SABR model for a given set of parameters.
The error is quantified as the sum of squared differences between market volatilities and the model volatilities.
Solver - Calibration:

The calibrate_sabr function is where the calibration magic happens. Here, the minimize function from scipy.optimize is utilized.
Given a set of market-observed implied volatilities across different strike prices, the function tries to find the SABR parameters (alpha, beta, rho, and nu) that minimize the calibration_error. This process is known as calibration.
The minimize function needs initial guesses for the parameters (initial_params), and constraints (bounds) to ensure the values remain within plausible limits.
Main Execution:

In the main function, you provide example market data (market_strikes and market_vols), which represent different strike prices and their corresponding observed market implied volatilities.
You also define a forward price F and a time to expiration T.
The script then calls the calibrate_sabr function with this data, which returns the calibrated SABR parameters that best fit the market data.
These parameters are then printed out.
How to use it:
Input Your Market Data:

Replace the example market_strikes and market_vols lists in the main function with your real-world market data for different strike prices and their corresponding observed implied volatilities.
Define Forward Rate & Time:

Set the F and T variables to represent the forward rate and time to expiration of the options you're examining.
Execute:

Run the script. It will compute and print the SABR parameters (alpha, beta, rho, and nu) that best fit your market data.
Interpretation:

The printed SABR parameters can be used in the sabr_volatility function to compute implied volatilities that should align closely with the market data you provided. These parameters can then be used for future option pricing or risk management tasks based on the SABR model.
